Experience
----------
>###Sous Chef at Broward County Convention Center From 2004 - 2010###

>I led a group of cooks ranging from six to twenty people depending on business volume, I ordered the ingredients for a party’s menu and to organize the preparation of menu items. I also organized the timing of heating individual foods and plating the food to coincide with party timing. At any given time, I could be responsible for feeding up to two thousand people per meal not including any that may have been running at the time.
> In my time as the sous chef, our costs dropped several percentage points, from 29% to 26%. I reworked many of the order forms and the organization of tasks to be more efficient.


>###Line Cook at Luna Rosa from 2003 -2004###

>I worked as both a line cook and a pastry chef. As a line cook I was responsible for preparing my ingredients, organizing my station, and of course preparing menu items that were ordered.
When I ran the pastry side of the kitchen, I was responsible for making the menu, creating the recipes, ordering the ingredients and preparing all the elements necessary to make a given dessert. I also had to teach all the line cooks to put everything together for each dessert on the menu.
