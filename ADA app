==================

1.	Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?

>>I like solving problems. One of my calculus professors had us use Python, for loops, in order to solve problems that were all but impossible to solve by hand and that started my interest in programming. I have taken a course in JavaScript, css and html over this summer and will be taking a class in programming in Python that starts a week after this application is to be turned in.


2.	If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?

>>If I am accepted into this programming program, I would like to be working for a larger company or preferably a non-profit in either software programing or in operations. My dream job would be working for Planned Parenthood or something like Mary's place. I was a mid-level manager when I was a chef and would prefer to be a team lead instead of rising through management ranks. I just want to be great at what I do without being in charge of too many people.


3.	After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?

>>I think that in many ways we change the world of tech simply by being in it. By making women and people of non-binary gender a more common sight with in the world of IT we normalize the experience of working next to us and we normalize our own existence. I intend to be in a position that allows me to have a say in hiring decisions and in the framework of software. The code that goes into software is important but the framework directly impacts the code.


4.	Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

>>I used to be a chef and one party that I was preparing for was serving nearly every kind of shellfish available in south Florida and several different kinds of each variety. I neglected to order a certain kind of oysters, a certain kind of mussels and a certain kind of clam. Since there were several kinds of each on the menu I did not notice my mistake until the day of the party. My purveyor was amazing and got everything I had missed in short order.  I always treated my purveyors well, but that day I learned just how important that relationship was.
If I were to encounter the same kind of order today, I would create a chart that listed each variety of shellfish and check each off as I went through the ordering process.
